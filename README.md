# Car-Price-Prediction
 ðŸš— Car prediction with R language 

 ## Steps of process 

 1. Data Preparation:
    ### Data Source:
    Obtain a dataset containing car attributes (e.g., make, model, year, mileage, fuel type) and their corresponding prices. Kaggle is a good resource for finding datasets. 
    
    ### Data Cleaning:
    Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. 

    ### Feature Engineering:
    Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., calculate car age, categorize fuel types). 

    ### Encoding Categorical Data:
    Convert categorical variables (e.g., fuel type, transmission) into numerical representations that machine learning models can understand. 

    ### Splitting Data:
    Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. 

2. Model Selection and Training:
    ### Linear Regression: 
    A simple and interpretable model suitable for predicting continuous values like price. 
    ### Other Models: 
    Explore more advanced models like Lasso or Ridge regression, or even tree-based models if the relationship between features and price is complex. 
    ### Model Training: 
    Train the chosen model using the training data. 

3. Model Evaluation:
    ### R-squared:
    Measures the proportion of variance in the target variable (price) that is explained by the model. 
    ### Mean Squared Error (MSE):
    Calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual prices. 
    ### Other Metrics:
    Consider other metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 
    Visualizations:
    Plot predicted vs. actual prices to visually assess model performance. 

4. Example R Code Snippets:
    Loading Data.
    ```
    # Assuming your data is in a CSV file
    data <- read.csv("car_data.csv")
    ```

5. Important Considerations:
    ### Feature Importance: 
    Identify which features are most important for predicting car prices. 
    ### Overfitting: 
    Ensure that the model doesn't overfit to the training data by using techniques like cross-validation. 
    ### Domain Knowledge: 
    Leverage your knowledge of the car market to make informed decisions about feature selection and model selection.
